Hello, I am Steve.
I am currently a year 2 Computer Science student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. While I am pursuing academic success, I am also the president of the CUHK Computer Science Society and an ordinary member of the HKIE Student Chapter. 

During my term at HKIESC, I directed a newly found program - HKIE Young Mentor Program. I am required to lead members from different schools. Being the leader in the aforementioned societies, I have gained experience in team-building and leadership skills. 

In addition, I am also working on a coding project involving text-analysis technology. The project is currently in progress and will be posted in public soon.

For my future ambition, I would like to focus on AI-technology / Data-Science as they will be the major trends in Information Technology. As big data & Artificial Intelligence will be fundamental for the future, I want to make contributions to making it happen. On the other hand, I am also interested in UI / UX design as I have had a similar experience before and I found it enjoyable.
